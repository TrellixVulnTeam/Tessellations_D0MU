/**
 * Returns the possibly signed (unsigned by default) surface area of given
 * `shape`. For groups calls {@link area} for each child and returns sum of
 * unsigned areas.
 *
 * In general, for polygons and triangles, the sign of the result can be
 * used as indication of the shapes orientation (clockwise /
 * counterclockwise).
 *
 * For curves, lines, point clouds and rays the function returns 0.
 *
 * Implemented for:
 *
 * - AABB
 * - Circle
 * - Cubic
 * - Ellipse
 * - Group
 * - Line
 * - Plane
 * - Points
 * - Polygon
 * - Polyline
 * - Quad
 * - Quadratic
 * - Ray
 * - Rect
 * - Sphere
 * - Triangle
 *
 * @param shape - shape to operate on
 * @param signed - true, if signed area
