 * Projects given point `uv` (normalized coords) into the target space

 * together can be used to warp points from one shape into another.
 *
 * Currently only implemented for these shape types:
 *
 * - AABB
 * - Quad
 * - Rect
 *
 * @param shape - shape to operate on
 * @param uv - point to map in UV space
 * @param out - result
