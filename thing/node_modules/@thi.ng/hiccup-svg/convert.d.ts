/**
 * Takes a normalized hiccup tree of {@link @thi.ng/geom# | @thi.ng/geom} or
 * {@link @thi.ng/hdom-canvas# | @thi.ng/hdom-canvas} shape definitions and recursively
 * converts it into an hiccup flavor which is compatible for SVG
 * serialization. This conversion also involves translation & reorg of
 * various attributes. Returns new tree. The original remains untouched,
 * as will any unrecognized tree/shape nodes.
 *
 * @param tree - shape tree
